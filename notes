  "output: {'title': 'Mumbai Air Quality: Moderate Risk for Sensitive Groups', 'paragraphs': ['The air quality in Mumbai is currently moderate, with an AQI of 97. This means that the air quality is acceptable for most people, but sensitive groups such as the elderly, children, and those with respiratory conditions may experience some discomfort. The dominant pollutant is PM2.5, which is particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less.', 'PM2.5 can be harmful to health, as it can penetrate deep into the lungs and cause respiratory problems such as asthma, bronchitis, and lung cancer. Sensitive groups should take precautions to reduce their exposure to PM2.5, such as wearing a mask when outdoors or staying indoors when air quality is poor.', 'The air quality forecast for Mumbai is stable for the next few days. However, it is important to check the air quality index before going outdoors, as it can change quickly. You can check the air quality index on the Air Quality Index website or by using the Air Quality Index app.', 'If you have any concerns about the air quality, please consult with your doctor or a healthcare professional.']}",
